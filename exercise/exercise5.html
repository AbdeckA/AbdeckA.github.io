            To be, or not to be, that is the question:<br>
            Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
            Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
            And by opposing end them.<br><br>

            To die—to sleep, <br>
            No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br>
            The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks <br>
            That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation <br>
            Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; <br>
            To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub: <br>
            For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, <br>
            When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, <br>
            Must give us pause—there's the respect <br>
            That makes calamity of so long life. <br><br>

            For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, <br>
            Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, <br>
            The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay, <br>
            The insolence of office, and the spurns <br>
            That patient merit of th'unworthy takes, <br>
            When he himself might his quietus make <br>
            With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear, <br>
            To grunt and sweat under a weary life, <br>
            But that the dread of something after death, <br>
            The undiscovere'd country, from whose bourn <br>
            No traveller returns, puzzles the will, <br>
            And makes us rather bear those ills we have <br>
            Than fly to others that we know not of? <br><br>

            Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, <br>
            And thus the native hue of resolution <br>
            Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, <br>
            And enterprises of great pith and moment <br>
            With this regard their currents turn awry <br>
            And lose the name of action.
